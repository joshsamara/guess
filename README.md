Guess the word or number game


Game modes:
1) Word
2) Number

1) Words
========
Guess a word based on clues given after each guess
You're told the number of 'wrongs' and 'rights' after.
A 'wrong' is a right letter in the wrong place
eg.
The word:   Joshs
Your guess: Spain
Both words have an 's', but the 's' in the guess is not where the 's' in the word is so this would result in 0 right 1 wrong.

A 'right' is a right letter in the right place
eg.
The word:   Salty
Your Guess: Speed
Both words have an 's' and both have it in the start of the word.
Therefore this would result in 1 right 0 wrongs. 

These two results can be combined.
The word:   Pains
Your guess: Salty
This word has the 'a' in both the guess and the word in the same place, but the s in different places.
Therefore this would result in 1 right 1 wrong.

You can choose between 3, 4, and 5 letter words at the start.
5 letter words are suggested.

You can choose from easy and hard mode.
This just changes how much of the previous guesses are reported.
Easy shows all previous guesses and results
Hard shows just the most recent guess and result.

2) Number
=========
There are two ways to play number

You can:
a) Play higher or lower where you guess a number and are told whether or not your guess is high or lower than the guess
b) Guess the digits in the same way that you do with the words version of the game.

You can pick the number of digits in the guessed number as well as the reporting difficulty
